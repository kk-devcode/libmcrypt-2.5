Description: De-/Encryption Library
 libmcrypt is the library which implements all the algorithms and
 modes found in mcrypt.
 .
 libmcrypt supports the algorithms: BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, DES, TripleDES,
 3-WAY, SAFER-sk64, SAFER-sk128, SAFER+, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, RC6, MARS,
 IDEA, RIJNDAEL-128, RIJNDAEL-192, SERPENT, RIJNDAEL-256, CAST-128
 (known as CAST5), CAST-256, ARCFOUR, ENIGMA, PANAMA, XTEA and WAKE.
 Block algorithms can be used in: CBC, ECB, CFB and OFB (8 bit and n
 bit, where n is the size of the algorithm's block length).
 .
